# Coding Guidelines
This section defines project-wide coding guidelines.

## §1 Global
- §1.1 The package-prefix for the project is `at.fhj.swd14.pse`
    - Additionally, don't nest classes too deep; as a rule of thumb, don't add more than 2 package-levels
- §1.2 "Never go home on a broken build"
    - Quite a lot of people are sharing the same codebase, at least check your code locally, before pushing it to the repository
    - Mistakes can be made. If someone encounters a failing build or deployment, revert the introducing commit, and inform the committer about it
    - Verify your build (and deployment) on the project's [CI](https://jenkins.almost-a-blog.net)
- §1.3 This project's language is English and English only!
    - Code in other languages will be punished... or at least it should be
- §1.4 Use log4j for logging, instead of logging via System.out.x
    - Add `private static final Logger LOGGER = LogManager.getLogger(YourClass.class);` to your class
    - Log with `LOGGER.warn(...);`, `LOGGER.info(...)`, etc.
        - When logging exceptions, make sure you don't lose the stacktrace!
        - i.e. `LOGGER.warn("Unexpected exception occurred while doing X!", exception)` is better than `LOGGER.warn("Unexpected exception")`
    - Log-Levels rule of thumb... (shamelessly ripped of [this SO question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7839565/logging-levels-logback-rule-of-thumb-to-assign-log-levels))
        - **ERROR**: the system is in distress, malfunctioning of huge parts of the system, end-users are directly affected (or will soon be)
            - Apply the "2am rule" - If you're on call, do you want to be woken up at 2AM if this condition happens? If yes, then log it as "ERROR"
        - **WARN**: an unexpected technical or business event happened, customers may be affected, but probably no immediate human intervention is required
            - On call people won't be called immediately, but support personnel will want to review these issues asap to understand what the impact is
            - Basically any issue that needs to be tracked but may not require immediate intervention
        - **INFO**: things we want to see at high volume in case we need to forensically analyze an issue 
            - System lifecycle events (system start, stop) go here
            - "Session" lifecycle events (login, logout, etc.) go here 
            - Significant boundary events should be considered as well (e.g. database calls, remote API calls)
            - Typical business exceptions can go here (e.g. login failed due to bad credentials)
            - Any other event you think you'll need to see in production at high volume goes here
        - **DEBUG**: just about everything that doesn't make the "info" cut... 
            - any message that is helpful in tracking the flow through the system and isolating issues, especially during the development and QA phases
            - use "debug" level logs for entry/exit of most non-trivial methods and marking interesting events and decision points inside methods
        - **TRACE**: don't use this often, this would be for extremely detailed and potentially high volume logs that you don't typically want enabled even during normal development 
            - Examples include dumping a full object hierarchy, logging some state during every iteration of a large loop, etc
    - You can change the log-level in the component's `log4j2.xml`
        - Locate the logger with name `at.fhj` and change it's level to the desired one
- §1.5 Write JUnit Tests for your code!
    - First of all, you get practice writing tests
    - Also tests increase confidence for changes and take away fear of breaking existing stuff
    - Further, other's may see the intention behind someone else's code when looking at their tests
- §1.6 Use [Mockito](http://site.mockito.org/) for mocking/stubbing stuff in your tests
    - Feel free to write mocks yourself, but it's definitely not recommended
    - ... and NO, we will not add another mocking framework!
- §1.7 Use meaning full commit messages
    - If we see one of [these](http://whatthecommit.com/) commit messages, you shall be hunted to depths of hell
    - No, seriously... do yourself and others a favor and write meaningful commit messages to give other's (and your future self) a glimpse of the commit's changes
    - If you are really into it, you might want to read [this](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
- §1.337 The architects are always right!
- §1.338 If the architects are wrong, refer to §1.337!

## §2 Views
- §2.1 Use [Primefaces' components](http://www.primefaces.org/showcase/) where possible
    - Custom styling will only be applied to Primefaces' components

## §3 Frontend-Beans
- §3.1 Use `@Named` instead of `@ManagedBean`
    - See [this SO question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4347374/backing-beans-managedbean-or-cdi-beans-named) for explanation
- §3.2 Frontend-Beans must be serializable
    - Add `implements Serializable`
    - Add `private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;`
        - It does not directly affect the code, but it's good practice to manually add it to serializable classes
        - In theory any long will do, but starting with "1" is a good practice when it comes to versioning

## §4 Backend-Interfaces
- §4.1 POJOs
    - Names should be suffixed with "Dto" as they are Transfer Objects between the backend and the frontend
    - Add `implements Serializable`
      - They must be serializable due to potential binary tranfer via CORBA, RMI, etc.
    - Add `private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;`
      - It does not directly affect the code, but it's good practice to manually add it
      - In theory any long will do, but starting with "1" is also good practice when it comes to versioning
- §4.2 Services 
    - Packages are named after the corresponding functionality
        - e.g. `UserDto` resides in package `user`
    - Services must only be interfaces
    - Services must be annotated with `@Remote`
    - Services must NOT be serializable
    - Methods (and optionally the interface itself) should have a JavaDoc describing their functionality
        - Refer to `at.fhj.swd14.pse.news.NewsService` for an example
    - Think twice before adding a checked exception to the throws list!
      - Never throw `java.lang.Exception` itself, except you have a very(!) good reason
- §4.3 No other objects must be within this component

## §5 Backend-Implementations
- §5.1 Use JPA for database entities
    - JPA entities must be `Serializable` (§3.2 applies here)
- §5.2 Backend services must be annotated with `@Stateless`
    - Stateful backend services should be reviewed with the architects, as these should usually not be required
- §5.3 Extend `AbstractRepository` for entity specific repositories
- §5.4 Use `@EJB` to inject beans
- §5.5 Create dedicated converter classes in `at.fhj.swd14.pse.converter` for converting between database entities and DTOs
- §5.6 Use `Long` for numeric primary keys

## §6 Database (and SQL)
- §6.1 Use `INNODB` engine for all database entities
- §6.2 Apply `NOT NULL` if possible
- §6.3 Use the `AUTO_INCREMENT` feature for primary keys 
- §6.4 Add `created` and `modified` to all tables
    - It is up to you to expose these columns in the entities or just leave it in the database
    - Use the below syntax to avoid introducing triggers
```
`created` TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
`modified` TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
```
- §6.5 Make scripts reexecutable
    - e.g. by adding `IF NOT EXISTS` to DDL instructions
- §6.6 Make sure the database type matches the one used in the entities
    - if the entity defines a `Long` the database type must be `BIGINT`, for `Integer` it is `INT`, and so on

# FAQ
This section contains common problems and their solution.
Feel free to update this section.

## Parent DTOs and Serializable

If you encounter the problem, that some values of your DTOs are null, specifically those inherited from a parent class, it may be possible, that only the child classes are Serializable and the parent class is not. This causes the child class to be serialized, but all attributes of the parent are set to null. If the parent class implements Serializable the child class however does not have to.

- TBD

## DB CRUD-Function tests
The jenkins server is not configured to support tests which require a db-connection. Therefore it is not possible/necessary to implement any DB dependent Unit-tests.
